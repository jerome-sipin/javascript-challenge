This is my (Jerome Sipin) submission for the Javascript homework.

This homework was the most difficult in a while, since there were a lot of tricky
components in getting the graphs to work. There were multiple times where I got stuck,
but somehow, random videos on YouTube from an Indian guy with 200 views
and questions asked on Stack Overflow work eventually. I also wasted some 2 hours
figuring out how to create a clean, grouped array with all IDs and counts for there
entire sample group, but it turned out I didn't need that since the bubble chart
only needed the sample data from a single person. Oh well, at least I know 
how to do that now.

Anyways, the main code is found in '/Belly Button Diversity/static/js/app.js',
which is linked to 'index.html' under the main 'Belly Button Diversity' directory.

To create the HTML code for the dropdown menu, I utilized a Python script to
read the json file and create an f string to make the HTML dropdown option code.
I felt quite smart when I thought of doing that.
